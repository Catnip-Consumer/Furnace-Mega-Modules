# Furnace Mega Modules

Here is a collection of music ports of Mega Drive to [Furnace by tildearrow](https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace). They are recreated with the attempt to be accurate-sounding to the original tunes, with as few special tricks as possible.

## License

Modules are shared under copyleft license, and credit to me and contributors is highly appreciated, but not required. Modules are provided as-is.

Please keep in mind, that for creation of the modules, other copyrighted works have been used. I do not attempt to claim ownership of this material. Some of the raw data such as samples and original music data was used to recreate the original compositions as faithfully as possible. This is not intended as copyright infringement, but for educational, research and personal use purposes. The original compositions contain copyrighted works attributed to at least the following;

- Sega Corporation, including composers hired by Sega Corporation
- Michael Jackson and other contributors related in some way to Michael Jackson's involvement with Sonic music
- Other composers that have contributed to the Sonic soundtracks
- Owners of material sampled by the previously mentioned entities

I solely claim ownership for the transformation of the original music data and compositions into the furnace module format, and stylistic decisions within said modules. Other contributors with modifications or fixes hold the right for credit for these changes.

## Contributing

This repository does not accept pull requests. If you have fixes, please open an issue. You can contribute changes via text, or by linking to relevant commit(s) or files and explaining the changes you made. This is done because Furnace modules are a binary format, and automatic merges may break the files. In addition, not all changes are immediately obvious from commits and do not allow me to make personal changes to files before merging commits.

You can also raise an issue explaining an issue with any content, by noting where an issue occurs and explaining the issue to best of your ability. The easiest thing is to show exact channels/patterns/rows where the issue occurs if applicable. The more detailed explanation, the easier the issue is to fix.

Do note that as I have updated the tools and fixed bugs, the newer modules are more accurate. This means that I intend to redo some of the older modules for accuracy.

In addition, more accurate instrument names would be very much appreciated.

## What is the plan

The plan is to eventually have the full soundtracks for the following games;

- Sonic 1
- Sonic 2
- Sonic 3 Prototype
- Sonic 3 & Knuckles
- Sonic 3D Prototypes
- Sonic 3D

In addition to some variations of the music when applicable. This may also include some remixed tracks (as fun easter eggs! Feel free to ask to contribute.)

## But why

Recreating the music by hand is very error-prone and slow process. Some musicians may want to use these tracks to create their own remixes or to help create their own tracks. Therefore, having the original tracks available will help musicians have an easy starting point. This repository tries to balance accuracy, and ease of editing. Therefore, some tracks are not 100% accurate, but only close enough, while others might have elemnts that are complex to change. This hopefully still allows for nearly indistinguishable versions of the tracks while being convenient for musicians.
